      <h2 class="ecosystem">The Vital Role of Trees in Our Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        Trees are nature's unsung heroes, playing a critical role in
        maintaining the balance of our planet. Through photosynthesis, they
        produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, combating climate change.
        Additionally, trees act as natural air purifiers, improving air
        quality by trapping pollutants. In ecosystems, trees provide habitats
        for diverse plant and animal species, contributing to biodiversity.
        Their root systems prevent soil erosion and aid in water conservation,
        reducing the risk of floods. Beyond environmental benefits, the
        presence of trees in urban areas has been linked to improved mental
        health and enhanced well-being. To ensure a sustainable future, it's
        crucial to recognize and protect the invaluable contributions of
        trees. Planting trees and supporting conservation efforts are simple
        yet impactful ways to preserve these silent guardians for generations
        to come.

      <h3 class="facts">Facts about the trees</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some trees can live for thousands of years. The oldest known tree is
          a Great Basin bristlecone pine named Prometheus, which was over
          4,900 years old when it was cut down in 1964.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees are vital for the production of oxygen. They absorb carbon
          dioxide during photosynthesis and release oxygen into the
          atmosphere. A mature leafy tree produces as much oxygen in a season
          as 10 people inhale in a year.
        </li>
        <li>
          Forests are home to a vast array of plant and animal species. The
          diversity of trees supports a rich ecosystem that includes insects,
          birds, mammals, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rainforests, characterized by dense tree canopies, are often
          referred to as the "lungs of the Earth" due to their role in
          producing a significant portion of the world's oxygen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The tallest known tree is a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)
          named Hyperion, standing at 379.7 feet (115.7 meters) tall. These
          trees are native to California.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees are found on every continent except Antarctica. They thrive in
          diverse environments, from the Arctic Circle to the Sahara Desert.
        </li>
        <li>
          The study of tree rings is called dendrochronology. Each ring
          represents a year of growth, and scientists can use this information
          to learn about climate conditions and historical events.
