        <h2 class="ecosystem">The Vital Role of Trees in Our Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>
          Trees are nature's unsung heroes, playing a critical role in
          maintaining the balance of our planet. Through photosynthesis, they
          produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, combating climate change.
          Additionally, trees act as natural air purifiers, improving air
          quality by trapping pollutants. In ecosystems, trees provide habitats
          for diverse plant and animal species, contributing to biodiversity.
          Their root systems prevent soil erosion and aid in water conservation,
          reducing the risk of floods. Beyond environmental benefits, the
          presence of trees in urban areas has been linked to improved mental
          health and enhanced well-being. To ensure a sustainable future, it's
          crucial to recognize and protect the invaluable contributions of
          trees. Planting trees and supporting conservation efforts are simple
          yet impactful ways to preserve these silent guardians for generations
          to come.

        <h3 class="facts">Facts about the trees</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some trees can live for thousands of years. The oldest known tree is
            a Great Basin bristlecone pine named Prometheus, which was over
            4,900 years old when it was cut down in 1964.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trees are vital for the production of oxygen. They absorb carbon
            dioxide during photosynthesis and release oxygen into the
            atmosphere. A mature leafy tree produces as much oxygen in a season
            as 10 people inhale in a year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Forests are home to a vast array of plant and animal species. The
            diversity of trees supports a rich ecosystem that includes insects,
            birds, mammals, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rainforests, characterized by dense tree canopies, are often
            referred to as the "lungs of the Earth" due to their role in
            producing a significant portion of the world's oxygen.
          </li>
          <li>
            The tallest known tree is a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)
            named Hyperion, standing at 379.7 feet (115.7 meters) tall. These
            trees are native to California.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trees are found on every continent except Antarctica. They thrive in
            diverse environments, from the Arctic Circle to the Sahara Desert.
          </li>
          <li>
            The study of tree rings is called dendrochronology. Each ring
            represents a year of growth, and scientists can use this information
            to learn about climate conditions and historical events.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="oxygen">The Oxygen-Generating Power of Trees</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Photosynthesis: Trees play a crucial role in photosynthesis, a
            process where they absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen using
            sunlight.
          </li>
          <li>
            Oxygen Production: Trees are prolific oxygen producers; they release
            oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abundance of Leaves: The large surface area of tree leaves allows
            for more efficient exchange of gases, maximizing oxygen production.
          </li>
          <li>
            Diversity of Tree Species: Different tree species contribute to
            overall oxygen levels, with some being particularly efficient oxygen
            producers.
